Have you ever heard of a movie called "Rain Man"? Well "Rain Man" is a movie about two brother, the elder brother is a man who is really really smart he had a photographic memory, he could remember everything that he saw, and he use this ability to outsmart the casino in a game of Blackjack, he using his brain to calculate probability in his head and make a lot of money. Blackjack is a game that heavily relie on math more than most of the other games, which often depend heavily on luck or bluffing. With a good mathmatical strategy, player might be able to turn an odd to my favor just like a Rain Man did. So i decide to do this project, to tried to create algorithm that replicate his play style. <br><br>


## Overview
According to my past repository that i tried to proof that the edge is on the house side, from that experiment the edge is on the house side if we didn't have any strategy to go against dealer, the longer we play the more we likely to lose. Because of Blackjack is design for a dealer to have more edge than a player, by letting player play before the dealer, this could lead to player getting busted before the dealer are actually play. But with a good technique, it could reduce busted rate and help manage cash in a long run. <br><br>
Technique that we are gonna use in this project 
1. Card Counting (For manage a bet amount in each round, if running count is high we bet high, if it's low we bet low)
2. Basic Strategy Chart (For lower risk of getting busted)
